## Game Design Project 2 - 2019
2D kitchen game where you control a meatball trying to get to the frying pan to complete the level. To complete this particular level, you had to jump on the plate up over the shelf and land on the moving rat that holds an oil and sit tight until reaching the button that removes the milk who's blocking the way to the frying pan
